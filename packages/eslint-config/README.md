Shared eslint configuration for the workspace. It too years to finally pick up the syntax for ESLint and now they completely scrap it with the stupid 9 formatting rules. TypeScript and JS compatible I'm not learning it over again so I'll retain the new syntax for about a day and never touching it again... Well isn't programming fun? ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜‚
